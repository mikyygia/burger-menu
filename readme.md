## Context
I just finished the "Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu" on Freecodecamp and decided to recreate my own menu. Also, I didn't section the image and title separately from the menu because I didn't learn that yet.

## Takeaways
It took so long to complete... Around 135 minutes or roughly 2 hours and 15 minutes haha. The CSS part, especially with the display: inline-block; elements messed me up. Apparently, there's a "whitespace" at the end of every paragraph (p) element. I still don't really know why that happens but putting all the p into a line instead of on the next row removes it. 

I'm simply glad it worked out all right.
