"read me" actually don't read me. it's more of a rant than anything. 

I just finished the "Learn Basic CSS by building a Cafe Menu" on Freecodecamp and decided to recreate my own menu without a website telling me what to do line for line.

Also I didn't section the image and title separate from menu because I didn't learn that yet. . . From then on, I ran with what I knew and ended up with this.

It took so long to complete.. Around 135 minutes or rougly 2 hours and 15 minutes lol. The CSS part, especially with the display: inline-block; elements messed me up. Apparently there's a "whitespace" at the end of every paragraph (p) element. I still don't really know why that happens but putting all the p into a line instead of on the next row removes it. 

I'm simply glad it worked out alright..
